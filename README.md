# 2023_11_mu_to
The `mu` stands for *parametric* and `to` stands for *transfer operator*.
This is work in progress for a paper on the extension of the work in [this paper](https://git.bam.de/mechanics/paper/2020_02_multiscale) to the parametric setting.

## Tree
The following directory structure is used:

* src (inputfiles / source code + subdirs for examples)
* system (system information)
* figures (.tex, .py)
* tables (.tex)
* paper (latex sources)
* journal (final version as pdf)
* notes (.md, .tex)

The results are not stored in git for now.
Each instance of the workflow will be stored locally under `./work`.
The `notes` dir is used to write down ideas and important equations (project sheet).
